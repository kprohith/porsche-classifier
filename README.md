# [Porsche Classifier](https://porsche-classifier.onrender.com/)
# Identify [Porsche](https://porsche.com) models(718, 911, Taycan, Macan, Cayenne, Panamera) with 95% accuracy.

Trained using [fastai-v3](https://fast.ai), [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Gradient](https://gradient.paperspace.com/).
Uses [resnet50](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/resnet50.html) and trained on a [Nvidia Quadro P5000](https://images.nvidia.com/content/pdf/quadro/data-sheets/192195-DS-NV-Quadro-P5000-US-12Sept-NV-FNL-WEB.pdf)
Built on [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and is hosted on [render](https://render.com/)
Trained on a dataset of publicly sourced images containing 30000 Porsche car models of varying degree of quality.
Porsche cars, specially the latest generations of the Panamera/Taycan,Macan/Cayenne & 911/718 can be 
pretty tricky to tell apart for a layman who isn't paying very close attention, 
which is why I wanted to test out what kind of features this deep learning model would pick up.
